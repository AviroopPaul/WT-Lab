            Prof. Achyuta Samanta is an educationist, philanthropist, 
            and social worker. He is the founder of Kalinga Institute of Industrial 
            Technology (KIIT) and Kalinga Institute of Social Sciences (KISS), 
            both educational institutions of global repute and recognition. 
            KIIT is an Institution of Eminence and one of the most prominent 
            universities in India and globe for professional education having more than 
            30,000 students from all over India and 65 other countries. 
            Besides Education and tribal upliftment, healthcare and rural development, Shri Samanta has contributed immensely to art, culture, literature, film, media, society and national integration. It is really incredible that the child who lost his father at the age of four, brought up amidst severe poverty and deprivation with seven siblings and a widow mother in a quaint village in Odisha has accomplished this monumental work without any favour or backing in such a short span of time for the society. He has converted the remote village ‘Kalarabanka’, Cuttack into a Smart Village and the entire Manpur Panchayat into a model Panchayat (cluster of villages).

            KIIT was established in 1992 as a vocational training centre with only two staff and 12 students. However, it took shape as an institution only in 1997, when degree engineering programme commenced. KIIT owes its existence to the vision of its founder Prof. Achyuta Samanta who, with no land, limited finances (only Rs. 5000/-) and little knowledge of higher education to create an institution for the benefit of the society. From these small beginnings, KIIT has developed into a leading university with a strong interdisciplinary culture and a commitment to teaching excellence.
